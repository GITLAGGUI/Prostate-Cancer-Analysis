## About this Dataset

This synthetic dataset simulates 1,000 individual health profiles focusing on potential risk factors for prostate cancer. The dataset is designed to support public health awareness, machine learning research, and medical decision-support application development.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men globally. While early detection through regular checkups can help prevent fatal outcomes, many lifestyle and behavioral factors contribute to increased risk.

This dataset includes a variety of features such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, diet, physical activity, family history of cancer, mental stress levels, and health-check behavior. Each row is labeled with an estimated prostate cancer risk level (Low / Medium / High) based on a rule-based scoring model.

The dataset is purely synthetic and contains no real patient information. It is safe for educational, research, and development use.

## Disclaimer

This dashboard is designed for clinical research and educational purposes. All clinical decisions should be made in consultation with qualified healthcare professionals. The analytics and predictions provided are supplementary tools and should not replace clinical judgment or established medical protocols.
